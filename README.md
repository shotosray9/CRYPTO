# Cryptography Projects
1. Sieve of Eratosthenes:
A java program to compute number of primes till a number using Sieve of Eratosthenes. 
A modified implementation of the algorithm to also be able to compute primes between two numbers. 
2. Linear Feedback Shift Register:
Implementation of an LFSR which takes in length of content, initial content, tap vector and plain or cipher text. Outputs the key stream and xor of keystream and original plain or ciphertext
3. Solved LFSR:
Retrieves tap vector and initial content of register given the key stream or part of the key stream.
4. Square roots of blum primes:
Solves quadratic congruence and returns square roots of blum primes
